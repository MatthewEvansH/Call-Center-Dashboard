## Potential Insights and Decisions Based on the Call Center Dashboard:
1. **Focus on Billing Queries**:
   - Given that Billing Questions are the top reason for calls, there should be enhanced training for agents on handling billing queries efficiently.
   - Implementing more self-service options on the website for billing-related issues could reduce call volume.

2. **Improvement in SLA Compliance**:
   - Since a significant number of calls are below SLA, efforts should be made to improve response times.

3. **Sentiment Improvement**:
   - The high volume of negative and very negative sentiment calls suggests a need for better customer service and resolution processes.
   - Implement feedback mechanisms to understand the reasons for negative sentiments and work on those areas.

4. **Channel Optimization**:
   - With Call Center being the most used channel, there may be an opportunity to divert some traffic to more cost-effective channels.
   - Enhance the capabilities of both the web and chatbot channels to handle more traffic.

5. **State Strategies**:
   - Target states with the highest call volumes for special attention.
   - Provide more localized support or targeted communication to address common issues in those regions.
