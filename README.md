## Potential Insights and Actions Based on the Call Center Dashboard:
1. **Focus on Billing Queries**:
   - Since billing questions account for the majority of calls, agents should receive advanced training to handle these queries more effectively.
   - Adding more self-service options on the website for billing issues may help reduce the number of calls.

2. **Enhancing SLA Compliance**:
   - Since a significant number of calls are below SLA, efforts should be made to improve response times..

3. **Sentiment Improvement**:
   - The high volume number of calls with negative and very negative sentiments indicates a need for improved customer service and resolution processes.
   - Introduce feedback mechanisms to understand the causes of negative sentiments and work on those areas.

4. **Channel Optimization**:
   - Since the Call Center is the most utilized channel, consider shifting some traffic to more cost-effective channels such as the web and chatbot and improve both channels to handle a greater volume of inquiries.

5. **State-Specific Strategies**:
   - Focus on states with the highest call volumes to provide them with special attention.
   - Offer more localized support or targeted communication to resolve common issues in these regions.
